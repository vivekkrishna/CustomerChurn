The main notebook NBF0RBGD16_91.6_Choppak.ipynb is built to predict the customers who are going to churn out next month based on the data of six previous months.

## Usage

The features for this model is extracted from confidential data and hence can't be shared. The features building process is tightly 
coupled with the structure of data we dealt with hence can't be directly useful for you. However some key insights regarding 
feature engineering, model parameter optimization, time series prediction can be deduced.
